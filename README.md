# e2ews

Sandbox project to simulate end-to-end encryption to wrap around [lucko/bytesocks](https://github.com/lucko/bytesocks). **!!This is not a battle-tested E2E flow!!**

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.6. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
